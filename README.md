App Idea - Planner App
 A planner app that functions as a social media app where you can add family members/partners/friends. You can then collaborate on making plans. For family members and friends, this app can be used similar to the notes app where users can collaborate on a text document which can be used for a variety of use-cases. An additional feature is the implementation of a calendar and todo list. There can also be a feature where those who are connected can make plans to meet up for activities (i.e. brunch, picnic, bowling, etc.). Connected users can vote on dates, times, and activities via interactive polling system.
